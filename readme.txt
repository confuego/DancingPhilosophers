For your programming task, what were the challenges that you faced? Where was there competition for resources, and where was there a need for cooperation?


In your imperative implementation, what aspects of the task were straightforward, and which ones felt laborious?


What kinds of bugs did you run into for the imperative implementation â€“ deadlock? How did you attempt to inspect what was going wrong with the code? (Did you use any debuggers or anything? You weren't required to do so, I'm just curious how your experience went).


In your Haskell implementation, what aspects of the task were straightforward, and which ones felt laborious?


Again, what kinds of bugs arose during development, and how did you handle them?


Lastly, what piece of advice do you wish you had received at the start of the assignment?
